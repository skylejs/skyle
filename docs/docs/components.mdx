title: Skyle Components
---

In order for Skyle to work properly, the library replaces React-Native's components (View, Text, ScrollView, Image, etc.) with extended versions.
Therefore, all component-specific features (Transitions, Pseudos, PointerEvents) are available internally with all React-Native components.

Simply import them like you normally would (and use Skyle's StyleSheet) for the features to work:

```ts
import { View, Text, Image } from 'react-native';

...

<View style={this.styles.view} />
```
