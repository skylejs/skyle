Pointer-Events exist in React Native but are passed down using a prop.
With Skyle's [StyleSheet](api/stylesheet.mdx), you can also use them as properties.

```ts
StyleSheet.create({
  view: {
    pointerEvents: 'none',
  },
});
```

Possible values (same as React Native): `auto`, `none`, `box-none`, `box-only`.

> @see https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#pointerevents

:::note
You can still use the old way by passing the prop as usual.
