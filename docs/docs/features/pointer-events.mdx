Pointer-Events exist in React Native but are passed down using a prop.
If you are using <a href='/docs/components'>Skyle components</a>, You can also use them inside StyleSheets.

```ts
StyleSheet.create((o) => ({
  view: {
    pointerEvents: 'none',
  },
}));
```

Possible values (same as React Native): `auto`, `none`, `box-none`, `box-only`.

> @see https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#pointerevents

:::note
You can still use the old way by passing the prop as usual.
