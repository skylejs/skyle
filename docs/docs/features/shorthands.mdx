:::note

These are for improved styling but you can still use the old ways.

:::

For some reason, React Native doesn't support shorthands<span style={{ opacity: 0.6 }}>\*</span> like CSS. They make styling a lot easier.

```ts
/* Shorthand padding/margin */
padding: [10, 20], // [vertical, horizontal]
padding: '10% 10 20px 5em',
margin: [5, 10, 2, 5], // [top, right, bottom, left]
margin: '10px 3px',

/* Shorthand border */
border: [5, 'solid', 'red'], // [width, style, color]
border: '5 solid red',
border: '12px dotted #00ff00',
```

\* In case you aren't familiar with the word 'shorthand':

> Shorthand properties are CSS properties that let you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously.
