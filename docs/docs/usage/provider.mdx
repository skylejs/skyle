Some features rely on the use of Skyle's [Provider](api/context.mdx). Simply wrap your application as shown below.

```tsx
...
import { Provider as StyleProvider } from 'skyle';

// Your root component
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <StyleProvider>
        // your app's content
      </StyleProvider>
    )
  }
}
```

You can also pass configurations to the provider: [Theme](features/theming.mdx)
